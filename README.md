# Productivity

As an unemployed mathematician and programmer, every time I sit down to work on a project, my mind floods with ideas for other projects, goals, and potential improvements. To filter out these distractions, I am building this app.

I believe focus is defined by your ability and efficiency in accomplishing goals. This app helps you strengthen your focus by dedicating your full attention to one task at a time. It tracks how long each task takes and stores that data for later comparison and efficiency analysis.
